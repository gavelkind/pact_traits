This mod for Crusader Kings II helps players negotiate ''non-aggression pacts'' and ''alliances''.

These pacts can be negotiated based on marriages between ''close relatives'' of each ruler. Close relatives are children, siblings, aunts/uncles, nieces/nephews, grandparents, and grandchildren. With dozens of close relatives, many of whom have spouses with large families of their own, it can be difficult to keep track of who you might be able to ally with.

This mod adds four traits:

* ![icon](icons/trait_close_relative.png) - `close_relative` - your close relatives, whose marriages will expand the set of rulers you can ally with
* ![icon](icons/trait_ally.png) - `ally` - your allies
* ![icon](icons/trait_active_nap.png) - `active_nap` - your non-aggression pacts
* ![icon](icons/trait_potential_nap.png) - `potential_nap` - characters whose close relatives are married to yours; those who are rulers can negotiate non-aggression pacts followed by alliances

You can search for characters with these traits by typing trait names in the Character Finder. In the following example, William of Normandy searched for `potential_nap` to find allies for his was on England. He can negotiate a pact with Thibault of Champagne because William's half-sister Adelaide is married to Thibault's nephew Eudes.

It will break save compatibility between major versions of the game, or when installing other mods that also add traits.
