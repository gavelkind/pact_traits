This mod for Crusader Kings II helps players in setting up non-aggression pacts and alliances.

These pacts can be negotiated based on marriages between "close relatives" of each ruler. "Close relatives" includes not only children and siblings, but also uncles, nieces, and grandchildren. With dozens of close relatives, many of whom have spouses with large families of their own, it can be difficult to keep track of who you might be able to ally with.

This mod adds four traits:

* ![icon](icons/trait_close_relative.png) - `close_relative` - your close relatives, whose marriages will expand the set of rulers you can ally with
* ![icon](icons/trait_ally.png) - `ally` - your allies
* ![icon](icons/trait_active_nap.png) - `active_nap` - your non-aggression pacts
* ![icon](icons/trait_potential_nap.png) - `potential_nap` - characters whose close relatives are married to yours; those who are rulers can negotiate non-aggression pacts followed by alliances

You can search for characters with these traits by typing trait names in the Character Finder.

It will break save compatibility between major versions of the game, or when installing other mods that also add traits.

![img](https://www.squarefree.com/crusaderkings/icons/Ironman_enabled_restrictions_24.png) This mod disables ironman achievements. It only gives you faster access to information you already have, but it does so by adding decisions and events, so the game engine considers it a possible cheat.
